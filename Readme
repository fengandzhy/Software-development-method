# Purpose
This project is a practice project built for a researcher to collect data about software development team's feelings for further research. Team members 
participate in the survey as volunteers. Team members get notifications from us and can submit their and their team's feelings through either the App or Web pages. 

# Architecture Briefs
The server side of the system provides RESTFUL APIs for the Clients (App and Web pages), using node.js and express.js. The notifications are sent out in Cron jobs.
However, as the notification time schedule can be changed by through web APIs, Cron processes communicate with web request processor processes using message queues.
